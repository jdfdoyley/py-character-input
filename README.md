# Character Input

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print
out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn
100 years old. Note: for this exercise, the expectation is that you explicitly
write out the year (and therefore be out of date the next year).

Extras:

- Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and
printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of
operations exists in Python)

- Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint:
the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)
